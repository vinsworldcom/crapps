CRAPPS - Cisco Router Action Performing Perl Script
Author:  Michael J. Vincent

Version 3.02 - 09 JUL 2015

only available on GitHub.


Version 3.01 - 22 JUN 2015

Enabled SNMPv3 support.


Version 3.00 - 22 APR 2015

New version using Cisco::SNMP.

installs from CPAN.

Cleaned up code.
Subs for tasks.


Version 2.11 - 5 OCT 2012

IPv6 support with -6, -4 options.  Everything but Net::Ping supports 
IPv6 now.


Version 2.08 - 24 FEB 2012

Updated version check for non-required modules.  Allowed multiple 
-metric arguments (comma-separated) for SNMP interface queries.


Version 2.08 - 24 FEB 2012

Updated version check for non-required modules.  Allowed multiple 
-metric arguments (comma-separated) for SNMP interface queries.


Version 2.07 - 23 OCT 2011

Changed -Inventory option to use Cisco::Management (0.05).


Version 2.06 - 14 APR 2011

Added port option for Telnet mode (host[:port]) for devices such as 
Quagga routers or terminal servers.  Also added -T option for initial 
carriage return when connecting to terminal servers.

Thanks to William Pleasants for feature request and testing against 
a Cisco terminal server.


Version 2.05 - 10 JAN 2011

Updated -f option to include force on connection errors.  Minor 
updates in some output formats from some subroutines.


Version 2.04 - 22 DEC 2010

Added -V option for inventory (-i for interfaces must be -int).
Fixed bug if error occurs when not printing output file in some 
subroutines.


Version 2.03 - 19 DEC 2010

Fixed bug in interface utilization where entire IF-MIB was returned 
even when only asking for single metric such as Octets or Errors.


Version 2.02 - 04 NOV 2010

Updated to require version 0.04 of Net::SNMPTrapd and Net::Syslogd.


Version 2.01 - 11 JUN 2010

Updated -w options in TELNET mode to allow output to STDOUT.


Version 2.00 - 05 MAY 2010

Full conversion to Cisco::Management 0.03.  Added conditional use 
for some modules.


Version 1.98 - 26 APR 2010

Added -f option for force continue on errors in Telnet.  Converted 
Sylogd and SNMPTrapd modes to use Net::* modules.


Version 1.97 - 12 JAN 2010

Changed SNMP Trap server from Convert::BER to Convert::ASN1.


Version 1.96 - 22 DEC 2009

Added many enhancements to all modes and reorganized POD to print a 
more helpful, easy to follow man page.


Version 1.95 - 01 DEC 2009

Added Ping mode when no options specified.  Made -t required for SNMP 
TFTP mode to facilitate SNMP system MIB retrieval.


Version 1.94 - 22 SEP 2009

Added --metric option for SNMP mode to allow monitoring of different 
interface parameters from the IF MIB.


Version 1.93 - 13 JUL 2009

Added TFTPd server for -S server mode.  Uses Net::TFTPd, which as of 
this README is version 0.04 on CPAN.  Older verions (0.03) had some 
issues (reported by yours truly).  The script will work with Net::TFTPd 
0.03; however, a warning message is printed.  This distribution includes 
the latest Net::TFTPd (0.04).


Version 1.92 - 12 MAY 2009

Added MD5 password encryption/crack feature to -P option.


Version 1.91 - 08 MAY 2009

Added password encryption feature to -P option.  Updated Cisco's XOR 
key from 26 elements to the full 53.  Also added length detection 
feature to concatenate the key if the requested decode/encode is longer 
than the key.  This fixes the decode bug if the supplied password was 
to long for the shorter key.


Version 1.90 - 03 MAY 2009

SNMP Trapd service added.


Version 1.89 - 28 APR 2009

Added -S service feature to incorporate simple syslogd functionality.  
SNMP Trapd will come next if I can understand ASN.1 encoding and why 
Convert::BER doesn't do it so well and Convert::ASN1 is the worst 
documented piece of code I've ever seen.


Version 1.88 - 16 APR 2009

Added SNMP proxy ping functionality with -i option set to IP address or 
hostname.  Updated code in SNMP interface utilization sub to track 
missed polls and compensate (slightly) when calculating utilization.


Version 1.87 - 09 APR 2009

Added SNMP memory utilization with -i option set to '00'.


Version 1.86 - 07 APR 2009

Added SNMP CPU utilization with -i option set to '0'.  Updated output 
logging file naming to include ifIndex if SNMP -i option is used and 
put the date - in case of duplicate file name - before the .log extension.
Added comments for memory utilization via SNMP, which is probably the 
next feature to add.


Version 1.84 - 30 MAR 2009

Updated minor "bug" in -w log to file for SNMP Interface Util that 
didn't update output file until command ended.


Version 1.83 - 25 MAR 2009

Updated minor "bug" in range determination for SNMP line clears (a 
mistaken decremented range, eg: 8-5, at the end of the -l argument 
caused an error.  Added -w log to file for SNMP Interface Util.


Version 1.81 - 11 MAR 2009

Made -p and -e password options interactive by not requiring password
on command line.  They can still be used on command line for batch 
processing, but now can also be used interactively with no screen echo
for password typing.


Version 1.8 - 03 MAR 2009

Added -i interface option for SNMP polling of interfaces.


Version 1.7 - 04 FEB 2009

Added Ctrl-C interrupt handler for infinite replay/repeat.  Added
verbose command printing.


Version 1.6 - 30 JAN 2009

Added repeat and replay command options.  Launches tail.exe (if 
exists) when -w used in Telnet mode.  Updated SNMP line output.


Version 1.5 - 08 DEC 2008

Added interactive option for command input to the -c argument.


Version 1.4 - 24 NOV 2008

Changed -w option to addative and now checks for existence of output
log file.  If exists, a new unique output filename is generated 
unless force overwrite option is selected.


Version 1.3 - 15 MAY 2008

Converted to new PERL template.
Removed requirement for -h to specify host.  Now extra command line 
args are intepreted as hosts.  Hosts can be hosts or files and if 
they are files, they are expanded to the hostnames before looping on 
hosts.


Version 1.2 - May 10, 2007

-h files ignore lines beginning with hash (#) as if they are comments.
Added increased buffer size from default of 1Mb to 5Mb for -w logging
option in Telnet mode.


Version 1.1 - July 28, 2006

Added -l option for SNMP query of router lines and option to clear 
lines.  This involed the addition of some lines in USAGE and the 
addition of several new sub-routines.


Version 1.0 - April 20, 2006

Initial release of 'crapps' project.  There were many before this, but 
this one was the one that had all the bells and whistles in this ZIP 
package.
